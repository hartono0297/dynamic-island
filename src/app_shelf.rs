//! The island's side of the file shelf: what is on it, the cards drawn from
//! that, a dropped list, and a card pressed and pulled out. A child of `app`,
//! so it works on `App` directly. The list and the cards' data are
//! `shelf.rs`; the OLE drop target and `DoDragDrop` are `shelf_ole.rs`; the
//! reducer only knows the shelf is open and which card was clicked.
//!
//! The shelf lives in memory: a restart empties it. Nothing runs while it
//! is closed; whether a file is still there is looked at when the page
//! opens, after a drop and before a card is opened or dragged.
//!
//! Cards animate in, out and across (`ui::shelf_motion`): a drop, a removal
//! and "Kosongkan" snapshot the cards and their places before the list
//! changes and hand both to the motion state. It counts in `animating_at`,
//! so the frame clock runs only while something moves.

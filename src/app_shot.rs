//! The island's side of the screenshot preview (Run 8): a new clipboard
//! image becomes a candidate, a short-lived worker looks for its file in
//! the Screenshots folder, the big notice shows it, and its buttons copy it
//! again, keep it or move it to the Recycle Bin. A child of `app`, so it
//! works on `App` directly. See docs/memory/screenshot-preview.md.
//!
//! Power: no watcher and no polling. One worker lists the folder when an
//! image arrives, and `TIMER_SHOT_RETRY` (a one-shot) runs at most four more
//! within about 5.5 s; `TIMER_SHOT_SHOW` waits for a screen clip's overlay to
//! close at most three times; then nothing runs until the next image. A
//! Simpan or Hapus worker looks a few times a second at most until the
//! screenshot's match window has closed (about 5.5 s after it), then ends.

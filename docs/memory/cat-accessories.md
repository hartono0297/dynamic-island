# Cat accessories and the paint order (v3.8)

Seven choices (`CatAccessory`: None, Glasses, Bow, Nightcap, Scarf, Flower,
Crown), flat style on the 64 grid, drawn for every face (idle, blink, happy,
sleep, alert, sad, wave, music, sing, think, focus). Data and painters in
`src/ui/cat_style.rs`; `RobotPainter::paint` takes a `CatLook` (the coat and
the accessory) from every caller: the renderer (`Frame::cat`, set by
`app.rs` and the demo), the Settings preview and the accessory tiles. Coats:
[[cat-colours-and-surfaces]].

## The cat is ONE silhouette, painted in this order

1. Black only: the rim under everything: both turned ears stroked 3.2 wider
   than their 5-unit stroke and the head stroked 3.2 wide, #8E7CB8.
2. The silhouette in the base colour: both ears (turned for the droop,
   filled, 5-unit round stroke) and the head, one colour, as before.
3. Calico only: the two patches, **cut to the whole silhouette**: the head
   united with both turned ears *including their stroke*
   (`CombineWithGeometry` UNION of the head, each ear's fill and its
   `Widen`ed stroke), the patches then intersected with it. Never clipped to
   the head alone. The forehead between the patches stays cream.
4. The face marks.
5. All accessories on top.

The owner rejected: a bow or flower behind the head; a light seam between a
calico ear and the head; ears painted over the head. The test
`calico_patches_are_cut_to_the_whole_silhouette_ears_included` checks that a
point in the ear above the head is in the patch (a head-only clip would drop
it), that the forehead is in neither patch and that nothing lies outside the
silhouette, for every ear state (rest, alert lift, asleep, sad).

Paths are built once: the head, ears and marks as before, the silhouette and
patches per ear state (`RobotPainter::calico`, keyed by the ear's `up` and
`droop`), and each accessory's pieces (`extras`, behind an `Rc`). Nothing is
rebuilt per frame, no timer is added ([[bata-idle-power-budget]]). A caller
that fades the cat does it with a layer round `paint` (the renderer's
`push_opacity`), so the passes never show through one another.

## The accessories (grid units)

- **Glasses**: two rings of r 6.6 at (24, 40) and (40, 40), stroke 1.9, a
  small bridge; espresso, cream on the Black cat. They follow the eyes
  (the head's slide and tilt, plus the eyes' extra slide).
- **Bow**: at (45, 23) on the right ear, raspberry #D23F6A, knot #F07A9A.
- **Nightcap**: a navy #2F4A7A cone over the dome with its tip to the upper
  left (clear of the z's by the right ear), a cream band and pompom at
  (14.5, 7). The pompom first sat at (10, 5), on the wave's cream heart at
  (4, 1): both cream, they merged into one blob. The test
  `no_accessory_covers_a_faces_cream_extras` keeps every piece's box off
  every face's cream extras (heart, z's, notes, thought dots).
- **Scarf**: a mustard #E0A526 band over the head's base and a short darker
  tail on the left.
- **Flower**: pink #F29BB5, five petals, amber #F2B33D centre, at (16, 23) on
  the left ear.
- **Crown**: a small gold #F2B33D crown on the dome between the ears.

Ear pieces use their ear's transform: the droop turn, and 0.6 of the alert
lift (`EAR_LIFT`; only the tip rises). Every piece follows the look's slide
and tilt (`Pose::looking`). Checked legible at the notch's 26 px and in the
40 px notice badge on the demo sheet `bata-accessories`.

## Clamp test

`the_looking_cat_stays_in_the_idle_island` (`geometry.rs`) now also takes
`accessory_corners(accessory, ears)` (every piece's box, the ear pieces
turned and lifted with their ear): inside the idle island and left of the
clock box, both styles, every notch size 160..300 x 28..44 (each 10 px x 2 px), with and without
the clock, for the five idle faces, open and blinking, at v -1..1. All seven
passed with the shapes above; `LOOK_HEAD_DIP` stays 7
([[cat-looks-at-pointer]]).

# Panel linger and panel motion

Two parts of one run. Part A keeps the panel open for a while after the user
did something in it; part B makes every change inside the open panel move
instead of pop, with nothing running at idle. Pure rules live in
`src/ui/motion.rs` (tested); the reducer part in `src/state.rs`; the frame
plumbing in `src/app.rs`; drawing in `src/ui/render.rs` and
`src/ui/render_panel.rs`. See [[open-mode]], [[bata-idle-power-budget]],
[[panel-pages]], [[stay-behind]], [[lyric-notch-width]],
[[studio-media-progress-timer]].

## A. Linger (`state.rs`)

`ACTIVITY_LINGER` = 4 s. `IslandState::linger_until` holds the deadline and
`lingering` mirrors "it is still in the future", re-evaluated at the start of
every `apply` (`panel_open()` has no clock; the "was open" values are read
before it, so the close still cleans up after itself). `panel_open()` also
holds while `lingering`.

Armed, only when the panel is open at that moment (never reopens a closed
one, nothing while shut by a tile, a fullscreen app or `Dismiss`), at the end
of `apply` around the event, not inside `click()`:

| Event | Arms when |
|---|---|
| `EditorOpen(false)` (closed, saved, deleted, cancelled) | the panel was open: the editor was often all that held it |
| `Click` (any hit but a media button the hover guard drops) | the panel was open and showing its content (not covered by a notice) |
| `Wheel` that turned a page | same |
| `CliFocus(false)`, `ClipFocus(false)` | something other than the linger still holds the panel after the event (`panel_held()`, hover). If the input alone held it, letting go closes it at once, as Esc always did, and an earlier click's linger is ended with it, never re-armed |

A new click re-arms (a fresh 4 s). The pointer may come back (hover holds the
panel as usual) and leaving keeps whatever is left.

Ended early by: `collapse()` (tiles, a copy with Enter, the search closing,
the Clipboard hotkey pressed while its page shows, lingering included),
`Dismiss` (a click outside), `Fullscreen(true)`, an `OpenMode` change, and
the panel closing for any reason (at the end of `apply`, `!panel_open()`
clears it). `Collapse::Shut/Left` always wins (`panel_open` needs
`collapsed == No`).

Expiry: `next_deadline()` includes `linger_until`, so the existing
`TIMER_DEADLINE` fires `Event::Tick`, `apply` sees it passed and the panel
closes through the normal morph. No new timer.

**Cost, one:** `outside_click_wanted()` is also true while lingering, so the
existing `TIMER_OUTSIDE` poll runs for those 4 s (it is what turns a click
outside into `Dismiss`). It stops when the linger ends.

**Gotcha:** many older state tests clicked or turned a page and then
`Hover(false)` expecting the panel shut. They use `leave()` now (leave plus a
`Dismiss`); the editor tests assert the linger then a `Tick`.

## B. Transitions

### Audit: what each view did before, what it does now

| View / change | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Idle, MediaCompact, MediaLyric, PomodoroCompact | content drawn at full alpha at once inside the morphing shape | when it replaces another view and the shape morphs, content fades in with the morph (`content_alpha`, 0 to 1 from 30 % to 100 % of the morph); a swap with no shape change (no morph) stays instant; the lyric notch's width-only resize is excluded (`resize`). Bata is never in the faded layer (`Renderer::robot_later`: drawn at full alpha after it), so he does not blink out, nor does a notice's alert bounce. A morph retargeted mid-fade carries on from the alpha it reached (`Anim::fade_from`, `motion::content_alpha_from`) |
| Notices (including the screenshot preview) | same | same fade in with the morph |
| The strip (sticky notice in the panel) | pops with the page | unchanged: part of the page's content, fades with the panel |
| Panel opens | content faded in with the height | same, now via `motion::panel_fade` (shared) |
| Panel closes | content gone on the first frame (the drawn view became the compact one) | the panel's content stays and fades out with the shape's height, the compact view fades in (`Transit::leaving`, `paint_leaving_panel`); no clicks while it closes. It draws what it showed (`ShownPanel`, below), not what the close reset |
| Page change by the wheel | slides | slides |
| Other page changes (Clipboard tile, page tiles, a disk warning's "Buka", the Mole notice, hotkeys over an open panel, a page switched off while it shows) | `follow_page` already ran after every applied event, but only looked at the view afterwards: a change at the same moment as the panel opening slid from nothing, a change under a notice slid unseen | `follow_transition` compares the panel before and after the event (`motion::transition`): slide only when it showed both before and after |
| A slide that starts during a slide | restarted from +-1: the page on screen jumped | continues the same strip (`SlideStrip`): every page on screen keeps its place, either way |
| Search over a page, and back | instant (no slide to or from it) | cross-fade of the two pages, 160 ms (`PageFade`, `PAGE_FADE_MS`) |
| Calendar Month/Week/Day | instant | `Reveal`: finer range from below, coarser from above |
| Calendar prev/next, "+N lagi" day paging | instant | `Reveal`: later from the right, earlier from the left; paging from the right |
| Notes and reminders paging | instant | `Reveal` from the right |
| Cleaner opening and closing over System | instant | `Reveal` from below, closing from above |
| Mole phases and its log toggle | instant | `Reveal`, fade only (the content changes in place) |
| Cleaner own/Mole switch | instant | `Reveal` from below |
| CLI tall and small | morph with the height fade | unchanged |
| CLI folder menu | instant | the menu alone reveals from below (the terminal keeps showing); closing is instant |
| Clipboard and Search results while typing | instant | instant, on purpose |
| Shelf drag highlight | instant | instant, on purpose |
| Volume plate | pops in and out on its timer | unchanged on purpose: it is feedback for a wheel notch |

### Rules

- `REVEAL_MS` = 160, ease-out cubic, offset `REVEAL_OFFSET` = 8 px, applied
  as an opacity layer over the page content (`paint_page_at`, a second D2D
  layer `layer2` because the panel's mask layer is already pushed). A reveal
  cut short by another starts from the opacity it had. Hit regions follow
  today's `settled` rule: they are registered on the first settled frame of
  the new content (a reveal moves it 8 px at most); only a slide or a page
  cross-fade holds them back (`motion::panel_regions_wanted`).
- **Gotcha, regions after a cross-fade:** `animate` draws the frame at the
  fade's end and then stops the clock, so that frame must register the
  regions. The renderer gets the fade only while `t < 1`
  (`motion::page_fade_frame`); passing `Some(1.0)` left the search, the
  Clipboard or the Shelf page with no click regions until something else
  redrew.
- **Slides are one strip** (`motion::SlideStrip`): the page coming in
  starts `from` widths away and eases to 0; the pages going out sit a whole
  number of widths from it (`trail`, up to `SLIDE_TRAIL` = 5) and move with
  it. A new notch puts the next page one width beyond the page that was
  coming in, so nothing on screen moves or vanishes (before, the page going
  out vanished: two notches 20 ms apart left it covering 75 % of the panel,
  and a reversal after two quick notches drew the page on the wrong side).
  A page that lands in the new page's slot (going back) is dropped, so is
  one that never shows during the new slide. `from` is capped at
  `SLIDE_MAX` = 4 widths: only a long fast spin reaches it, and then the
  strip jumps by the excess. The renderer gets at most two trail pages
  (`Frame::page_trail`, those with |x| < 1).
- **Gotcha, the closing panel's content:** by the time `refresh` starts the
  closing morph, `apply` has already reset what the panel showed (the
  cleaner, `cli_tall`, `cli_menu`, the notes, reminders and day pages; the
  strip is `None` once the view is not the panel). `App` takes
  `IslandState::shown_panel()` before each event and keeps it
  (`closed_panel`) when the event takes the panel off screen; `refresh` hands
  it to `leaving`, and `draw` builds the leaving frame from it (page, strip,
  page indices, CLI size and menu, cleaner and Mole stage), and
  `paint_leaving_panel` sizes it with the same `panel_kind`. Without a
  snapshot for that page there is no fade-out, never a reset page.
- The CLI folder menu's reveal uses `layer2` too, so it is skipped (the menu
  shows at once) while a page cross-fade is running: D2D cannot push one
  layer twice, and `EndDraw` would fail.
- Nothing is longer than the morph (`ANIM_MS` 240 ms): slide 220, reveal 160,
  page fade 160.
- A sub-view switch is detected by comparing `SubView` snapshots before and
  after each applied event (`panel_snap`): calendar view, anchor, day page,
  notes and reminders page, cleaner mode, Mole stage and log, CLI menu.
  Typing never changes one.
- **Reduced motion:** `SPI_GETCLIENTAREAANIMATION` is read at start and on
  `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` (no timer; the flag is read again on any setting
  broadcast). Off: no slide, no cross-fade, no reveal (instant), and the morph
  eases with plain ease-out cubic instead of `ease_out_back` (`Anim::plain`,
  `motion::morph_ease`). The morph itself and the content fades remain.
- Demo: `DI_DEMO_REVEAL=0.5` freezes a reveal (`cal-week-to-day`,
  `cleaner-open`) or the search's page cross-fade (`search-open`, over the
  Music page, as the island does it); `DI_DEMO_T=0.5` on a compact scene shows the
  morph's content fade and the panel fading out.

### Budget

Nothing new at idle and no new repeating timer. `reveal`, `page_fade`,
`slide` and the morph are in `App::animating_at`, so the existing
`FrameClock` starts when a transition begins (`ensure_clock`) and stops when
`animating_at` turns false. Only the linger's `TIMER_OUTSIDE` poll (above) and
one deadline on `TIMER_DEADLINE` are added, both only for the 4 s after an
action. See [[bata-idle-power-budget]].

**Not verified live:** the drawing (layers, the closing panel's fade, the
folder menu's reveal) was run in `--demo` only to check that nothing errors;
no screenshot was compared by eye. The owner should look at: a calendar
range switch, the cleaner opening, the search opening and closing, the panel
closing from the Music page, a notice appearing from the panel, and the
folder menu; and turn Windows' animation effects off once.

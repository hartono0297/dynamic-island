# Shortcut tiles you choose (v3.2 Run 7)

`src/tiles.rs` (`ShortcutTiles`, like `pages::PanelPages`): the Pintasan page
shows the tiles in `config.shortcut_tiles`, in that order, up to twelve (four
per row, up to three rows, `panel_layout::shortcuts_layout` wraps). Empty =
the default tiles (the nine built-ins, Search being the ninth since 3.2.1,
plus Vale Settings and the Shelf since 3.4), so old configs read as before.
Settings → Tampilan → **Pintasan** (laid out as in the 2026-10-29 section
below): the last tile shown cannot be hidden, and none can be switched on
while twelve show (`toggle` and `set_on` refuse; the off rows say "Halaman
penuh (maks. 12)" with a disabled "+ Tambah"). A list edited by hand can
still have more than twelve on: the rows past the twelfth say "Tidak tampil
(maks. 12)" (`beyond_limit`). Tile names in the file
(built-ins, `Custom`, the `kind`) are read in any case and written back in
the canonical spelling.

- **Built-in** entry: `{"tile":"Lock","on":false}`; each built-in is listed
  once, one missing from the file rejoins right after the one before it in
  `Shortcut::ALL`.
- **Custom** entry: `{"tile":"Custom","label","kind","target"}`; `kind` is
  `App`, `Folder` or `Url`. `CustomTile::new` is the one gate: label 1–14
  chars, target ≤ 500, no control characters; a `Url` must be http(s) with a
  host or `mailto:` (no `file:`, `javascript:`, `ms-*:`). An entry that fails
  is dropped when read, never kept to fail at click time. Max 8 custom. An
  absent `on` reads as shown.
- Click path: `Hit::Shortcut(s)` (built-in, as before) and
  `Hit::CustomTile(i)` (`i` = place among the tiles shown) →
  `Effect::RunCustom` → `Action::Custom` → `ShellExecute "open"` on the
  target, after the panel collapses like any tile. `Action` is no longer
  `Copy` (it owns a string).
- The settings scroll now counts text under the last card (the note under
  the Pintasan card), not just card bottoms.

**Not done (decision for the owner):** the "Perintah" kind (a shell command
per tile: a security surface, the plan wanted a first-run confirmation). The
add form is done, see "Page tiles, Vale Settings and the new Settings card"
below.

**3.2.1:** a built-in the file does not name (the new "Search" tile) rejoins
right after the built-in before it in `Shortcut::ALL`, and comes in *off*
when the page already shows twelve, so an upgrade never pushes an own tile
off it (`from_saved`); it can be switched on in Settings once another tile is
switched off (the twelve-tile limit above).

## Page tiles, Vale Settings and the new Settings card (2026-10-29)

- **New built-ins** in `Shortcut::ALL` (20 since v3.5, in this order): the nine,
  `ValeSettings`, then `Go(Calendar|Pomodoro|Reminders|Notes|Media|Mixer|Shelf|
  System|Cli)`. No Go tile for Search, Shortcuts or Clipboard (Clipboard keeps
  its own tile, which already opens its page). Names in the file are
  `"ValeSettings"` and `"Go"` + `pages::page_name` (`"GoShelf"`), read in any
  case, written canonically (`tiles::shortcut_from_name`).
- **`Shortcut::default_on()`**: the nine, ValeSettings and Go(Shelf) (v3.5 adds Go(Devices): 12 shown on a fresh install, so the page is full; 11 shown
  on a fresh install). A built-in the file does not name joins after its
  predecessor in ALL, on only when `default_on` **and** the page has room
  (the 12 rule is unchanged). An old nine-tile config therefore gets
  ValeSettings and the Shelf on (11 shown); a full twelve keeps its twelve.
- **Gotcha, all off:** a file whose tiles are all off is made whole *before*
  the missing built-ins join (it turns the default-on built-ins on). Judged
  after, the new tiles would count as shown and the file would stay empty.
- **Reducer:** `Hit::Shortcut(Go(p))` sets `page = p` like the Clipboard tile
  (no collapse; a page that is switched off opens for that visit only, the
  close path `leave_hidden_page` moves off it). `Hit::Shortcut(ValeSettings)`
  is `collapse_for(Effect::OpenSettings)`; `App` answers with the existing
  `open_settings(hwnd)`, as the last arm of `perform`. **Gotcha:** `perform`
  runs inside `with_app`, and `open_settings` calls `with_app` itself (it
  finds the app borrowed and returns), so the arm only sets
  `DEFERRED_OPEN_SETTINGS` and `run_deferred` opens the window once the
  handler returns. `shortcut_action` returns `None` for both, like
  Clipboard and Search.
- **Icons:** each Go tile uses its page's icon (`shortcuts::page_icon`);
  ValeSettings has its own `Icon::Sliders` so it is not the Windows gear.
  New in `icons.rs`, drawn by hand (not from the design file): `Sliders`,
  `Chip` (System), `Grip` (drag handle), `ChevU`. Labels reuse the `Page*`
  keys, except the Shelf ("Rak", `ShortcutGoShelf`: "Rak berkas" is too long
  under a tile).
- **Settings card (Appearance → Pintasan):** a header "Tampil di halaman:
  n/12" with *Kembalikan bawaan*; the tiles that are on, each with a drag
  handle, up/down (among the tiles shown; `ShortcutTiles::move_shown`),
  *Sembunyikan* and *Hapus* on an own tile; then *Tersedia* grouped
  Halaman (Go tiles and Clipboard), Windows, Vale (Settings and Search) and
  Milik sendiri, each row with *+ Tambah* (disabled with "Halaman penuh (maks.
  12)" while 12 show); then *+ Pintasan sendiri*. `TileOn(i)` is both hide and
  add (`toggle`); `reset()` puts the built-ins back and keeps own tiles after
  them, on only while there is room; `add_own` returns whether it came in on.
- **Own-tile form** (inline in the Tersedia card): Nama and Target are native
  EDITs created with the two Google ones (`Edits` has four hwnds, ids
  103/104, same subclass, colours and destruction; Esc closes the form, Enter
  adds, Tab swaps within the pair, `WM_APP_FORM` carries those). Jenis is a
  segment (Aplikasi | Folder | Web). *Pilih…* runs `IFileOpenDialog`
  (`FOS_FORCEFILESYSTEM`, `FOS_PICKFOLDERS` for a folder) from `run_after`,
  with the window state released (the dialog pumps messages); the COM
  apartment is the island's (the `--settings` demo initialises its own).
  `CustomTile::check` says which part failed; the message sits under the
  form, no message box. Adding off (page full) leaves a note for a few
  seconds. Settings still posts only `Action::ShortcutTiles`.
- **Native fields do not clip:** the form's EDITs hide unless their whole
  field rect is inside the scroll viewport, and the wheel re-places them.
- **Drag:** press on the grip (`SetCapture`), the row follows the pointer on
  a raised plate, the others shift (`display_order`), release commits through
  the pure `drop_index(y, row_tops)`, Esc or a lost capture cancels. The
  Settings model is updated at once (optimistic) and the owner confirms.
- Not verified by hand: typing into the form's fields and the file dialog
  (the logic around them is tested; the layout and the drag were checked in
  the `--settings` demo).

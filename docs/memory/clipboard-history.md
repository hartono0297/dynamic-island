# Clipboard history: what it keeps and how

Run 7 of the v3.1 plan (Keputusan #5). Code in `src/clipboard/` (pure:
`kinds`, `image`, `store`, the `persist` format; Win32: `win`) and
`src/app_clip.rs` (the island's side). Privacy rules are in
[[clipboard-privacy]].

- **Kinds.** Text, Link, Code, Color (hex `#RGB`/`#RGBA`/`#RRGGBB`/`#RRGGBBAA`),
  Image (thumbnail + width × height), Files (paths). `detect_kind` is pure:
  a link is one token (`http(s)://`, `www.`, or a bare domain *with a path*),
  so prose with a period or comma never is one; code is a known command
  with arguments, a flag, code marks, or several lines with braces,
  semicolons or indentation. Files beat text, text beats an image.
- **Cap and pins.** Newest first, "Jumlah item" 50 (10–200, step 10).
  Pinned entries are never pushed out by the cap; unpinned ones go oldest
  first, but never the newest entry (so a copy still shows when pins fill the
  cap). An external copy equal to an entry, or a copy from the island, moves
  that entry to the front: no duplicates.
- **Text over 64 KB is not kept at all** (not cut): pasting a cut copy back
  would silently lose its end.
- **Images.** Read from `CF_DIB` (Windows synthesises it from DIBV5/PNG
  apps), at most 64 MB. The thumbnail (≤ 184 × 128, four samples per pixel,
  opaque) is made straight from the DIB on the UI thread: cheap, no full
  decode. All thumbnails together stay under 4 MB (memory and file): the
  oldest unpinned image entries go first. The original DIB is kept in memory
  only, within 48 MB (oldest images lose theirs first).
  **A restored image (after a restart) copies back at thumbnail size**: the
  file never holds full-size pixels.
  "Screenshot · W × H" when only bitmap formats were on the clipboard,
  else "Gambar · W × H". `clip_image_arrived` hands a new image to the
  screenshot preview ([[screenshot-preview]]).
- **Persistence.** `clipboard-history.bin` next to config.json, DPAPI
  current user (`src/dpapi.rs`, shared with the Google token), plaintext
  wiped. Versioned binary (`DICB`, v1), written to `.bin.tmp` then renamed,
  on a short-lived thread, ordered by a generation counter. Writes coalesce:
  one one-shot `TIMER_CLIP_SAVE` 1.5 s after the last change; a pending save
  is flushed on `WM_DESTROY` and `WM_ENDSESSION`. Missing, foreign or corrupt
  file → empty history, never a crash. "Simpan setelah restart" off: nothing
  is written and the file is deleted.
- **Lock.** "Hapus saat layar dikunci" (default off) clears the unpinned
  entries from memory and the file on `WTS_SESSION_LOCK`. **Pins stay**:
  pinning is an explicit "keep this". The clear button in Settings does the
  same. Turning the history off shows "Riwayat clipboard mati"; the
  entries stay until cleared. The listener stops only when the screenshot
  preview is off too; with the preview on it still looks at new images
  (by the same skip rules) and keeps nothing.
- **Hotkey.** None by default. Settings offers Ctrl+Alt+V and Win+Alt+V,
  **never Ctrl+Shift+V** (paste as plain text in browsers, VS Code and
  Office). An unknown name in config.json reads as none. `RegisterHotKey`
  only when set; a failure shows in the row ("Dipakai aplikasi lain"). The
  hotkey opens the panel on the Clipboard page *without* the foreground
  (`clip_held`); it closes on a second press, when the pointer visits and
  leaves, or after an 8 s one-shot if it never came.
- **Page.** `Page::Clipboard` sits after Musik, with Sistem
  ([[system-page]]) as its right neighbour and then CLI: the interim order
  of the merge with Runs 4–6, nine pages (`Page::ALL: [Page; 9]`). Run 9
  sets the final order. The
  Pintasan Clipboard tile opens it instead of Win+V
  (`shortcuts::shortcut_action` → `None`). Two columns of 64 px cards,
  scrolled a row per wheel notch over the cards; the selected card gets the
  accent ring and its buttons (pin, copy as plain text, delete), drawn in
  the panel; a right-click selects a card. Clicking a card copies it.
  Keyboard: [[cli-panel-keyboard-focus]].
- **"Disalin".** `NoticeKind::Copied`, 1.5 s on the notice deadline, a newer
  one replaces it, never over a fullscreen app; Bata Happy
  ([[bata-robot-expressions]]), else the Clipboard badge. Only for copies
  made from the island unless "Disalin untuk semua salinan" is on; never for
  skipped content.
- **Power.** No repeating timer ([[bata-idle-power-budget]]). A change while
  the page is hidden draws nothing (unless a notice shows). Its one-shots are
  timer ids 20–22 (17 and 18 are the System page's).
- **Notices beside the cleaner's.** `Copied` is one more `NoticeKind` next to
  `SystemLow`, `CleanDone`, `MoleDone` and `MoleFailed`; a newer "Disalin"
  replaces only an older "Disalin", never a cleaner or system notice.

## Verify pass (2026-10-28)

- The newest image always keeps its full-size original, even past
  `FULL_BUDGET` (a 4K or 5K screenshot alone passes it); older ones share the
  budget. A card with only its thumbnail left says so when copied ("pratinjau
  kecil, aslinya tidak tersimpan").

- The fingerprint hashes every byte (8 at a time): a one-pixel change is a
  new image. Cards saved by 3.1.0 may not match a re-copy of the same image
  once (old fingerprint).
- With "Simpan setelah restart" off, a history file still on disk is removed
  at startup (`persist::start_items`).
- Text offered but too big to keep (a large Excel range) keeps its bitmap
  out of the history too (`win::wants_image`).
- "Hapus riwayat" needs two clicks, as "Putuskan".

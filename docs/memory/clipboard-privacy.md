# Clipboard: what the history must never see or touch

Rules behind [[clipboard-history]].

- **Excluded formats** (`kinds::EXCLUDED_FORMATS`, `should_skip`). Present
  means skip: `ExcludeClipboardContentFromMonitorProcessing`, `Clipboard
  Viewer Ignore`. A DWORD that is 0 (or that cannot be read) means skip:
  `CanIncludeInClipboardHistory`, `CanUploadToCloudClipboard`. KeePass,
  KeePassXC, 1Password and Bitwarden set one or more of these. The reader
  checks the registered formats' names *before* copying anything out; a
  skipped change stores nothing, shows no "Disalin" and is never logged.
- **The island's own copies.** After its `SetClipboardData` and
  `CloseClipboard` the island records `GetClipboardSequenceNumber()`; the
  `WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE` with that number, or any while `GetClipboardOwner()`
  is the island, adds nothing (`kinds::is_own_change`). The entry copied
  just moves to the front (`History::bump`). The CLI's hidden EDIT is a
  child window, so a Ctrl+C there is the user's copy and is recorded.
- **Busy clipboard.** `OpenClipboard` fails while another app holds it:
  the read retries with a 60 ms one-shot, at most four times (no repeating
  timer). Writing (a card click) waits 3 × 8 ms at most.
- **Never in tests or the demo.** No test and no demo calls `win::read`,
  `win::write`, `EmptyClipboard` or `AddClipboardFormatListener`: they would
  read, change or empty the owner's real clipboard. Tests feed
  `ClipSnapshot` fakes to the pure `ingest`; the demo builds its cards from
  fixed data (`demo_clips`, a fixed "now"). The file tests use a folder under
  `target/test-tmp/`, never `%APPDATA%`.

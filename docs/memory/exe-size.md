# Exe size: what was measured, what was trimmed

Measured with `cargo build --release --locked` (profile: `opt-level = "s"`,
lto, 1 codegen unit, `panic = abort`, strip). The shipped v3.5.0 exe is
2,479,104 bytes; the same source built in this worktree is 2,479,616 (the
embedded path of the PDB moves it by up to 512 bytes, so compare builds made
in folders of the same name length).

## Where the bytes are (2,441,728 after the icon change)

| Section | Bytes | What |
|---|---|---|
| `.text` | 1,909,760 | code: `vale` 1,000 KiB, `std` 572 KiB, serde_core/serde_json/chrono ~40 KiB each, hashbrown 32, `windows` 17 |
| `.rdata` | 275,456 | strings (i18n), tables |
| `.rsrc` | 208,384 | fonts 189 KB ([[studio-font-sources]]), icon 12.5 KB, manifest |
| `.pdata` | 37,376 | unwind tables |

`cargo bloat` (installed with `cargo install cargo-bloat`, needs
`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_STRIP=false` and its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to see
symbols): the biggest functions are `Renderer::paint_page` 55 KiB,
`app::run` 49, `App::apply` 30, `Renderer::page_layout` 27, `mole::serve` 26,
`std` process spawn 23. 3,000+ functions under 8 KiB make up 70 % of `.text`:
no single thing to cut.

## Tried

| Change | Exe bytes | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| baseline (v3.5.0 source) | 2,479,616 | |
| `opt-level = "z"` for everything | 2,153,472 (-326,144, -13 %) | **no**, see below |
| dependencies only at `z`, `vale` at `s` | 2,484,736 (+5 KB) | no |
| icon: small sizes as PNG frames, identical pixels | 2,441,728 (-37,888) | **yes** |
| `windows` features: drop `Win32_System_Com_StructuredStorage`, `Win32_System_WinRT`, `Foundation_Collections`, `ApplicationModel` (the only ones with no direct path in `src`) | did not compile (`STGMEDIUM`/`IDataObject::GetData`, `UserNotification::AppInfo`, screenshot frames need them) | no |
| fonts | untouched | see below |

- **`z` is an owner option, not applied.** It saves about 326 KB (about 2.12 MB
  with the new icon, derived not built) but the island
  animates the panel and the notch with per-frame drawing code, and no release
  demo can run inside the workflow to show the frame times are equal. Try it
  by hand (`opt-level = "z"` in `[profile.release]`), watch the page slides
  and the lyric scroll, then decide.
- **Icon.** `scripts/make-icon.ps1` now writes PNG payloads at every size (it
  wrote 32 bpp DIBs below 128 px). Same nine sizes, 50,457 -> 12,573 bytes.
  `src/ui/icon_frames.rs` decodes every frame through WIC and compares an
  FNV-1a hash of the BGRA pixels with the hashes taken from the v3.5.0 icon, and
  loads the embedded icon with `LoadIconWithScaleDown` at 10 sizes. The
  regenerated `logo-256.png` came out byte-identical, so the script is
  deterministic.
- **Fonts left alone.** The subset is already ASCII, Latin-1, Latin Extended-A
  and the symbols; by table, `glyf` is 21-27 KB of each 35-39 KB file, the
  rest is hinting, kerning (`GPOS` 12.7 KB in DM Sans) and a 0.9 KB `name`
  table the loader reads. Dropping layout features (`liga`, `calt`, `ccmp`) or
  hinting changes rendering; nothing else is worth the risk. New guard
  `src/ui/font_coverage.rs`: parses the `cmap` of the embedded TTFs, pins the
  count of mapped code points in the subset per font (DM Sans 325, DM Mono
  316), checks the symbols the UI draws (`·`, `×`, `÷`, `°`, `±`, `§`, `–`,
  `—`, `…`, `›`, `→`, `↑`, `↓`, `−`, quotes, `•`, `€`, `™`, `%`) and scans every
  non-test, non-comment character in `src/**` against DM Sans.
  Characters already outside the fonts, drawn through DirectWrite's system
  fallback today, are listed in `SYSTEM_FALLBACK` (`↗`, `↳`, `≤`, `▸`, `♪`,
  box drawing, `✓`, `●`). DM Sans has no `✓` and DM Mono has no arrows; that
  is how the source families are, not a loss from subsetting.
- **No dead code** to remove: the release and test builds are warning-free
  (rustc's `dead_code` covers a binary crate), and nothing else is proven
  unused by grep.
- **Not tried on purpose:** UPX, removing features, font swaps, dependency swaps
  (`serde_json/preserve_order` pulls `indexmap`, 5 KiB), static CRT (changes
  the redistributable story), `build-std` (needs nightly).

## Idle RAM and CPU

Not measured. The release exe is single-instance and reads real user data, and
the owner's Vale must keep running; the debug `--demo` process says little
about release. The changes here (a smaller icon resource) do not touch runtime
code. Idle budget stays as in [[bata-idle-power-budget]].

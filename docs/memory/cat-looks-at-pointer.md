# The idle cat looks toward the pointer

The cat in the idle notch turns its head toward the pointer, sideways only, with
an eased move. It shares one poll with the notch peek ([[notch-peek-eyes]]);
the cost rules are in [[bata-idle-power-budget]], the faces in
[[bata-robot-expressions]].

## When

`App::look_eligible`: `config.robot` on, `motion().moves()` (Full, and not
Energy Saver), the view is **Idle**, the cat is drawn there (`robot_frame` is
Some), the peek is not shrunk, not fullscreen, not `screen_away`. Idle only
(assumption): in the compact music, lyric and timer views the cat's slot is
tight, so it stays still there. Only a face that looks follows
(`Expr::looks`): of the idle faces Idle, Happy and Sad. Think and Sleep stay
centred, since their thought dots and z's float beside the right ear and
would slide 4 to 7 dip into the clock; a sleeping cat also stops the look's
ease and frames. `robot_frame` draws them with `Pose::looking_as`, which keeps
their pose centred even mid-ease.

## Maths (`pointer_watch.rs`, tested)

- `look_target(pointer_x, notch_centre_x, monitor_left, monitor_right)` in
  [-1, 1]: the horizontal offset over the distance from the notch centre to
  that side's monitor edge, clamped. Pointers on another monitor clamp to +-1.
  The island sits at the primary monitor's centre.
- `LookEase { current, target }`: `set_target` ignores a change under
  `LOOK_EPS` (0.02) and returns false (no redraw, no clock); `advance(dt)` is an
  exponential ease with tau 120 ms (`1 - e^(-dt/tau)`, the same at any frame
  rate, never overshoots), snapping within 0.002; `snap_to_centre()` puts
  both at 0 at once.
- `look_hidden(lowered, covered)`: the island is lowered by stay-behind and a
  window lies over it; `covered` is read only when lowered.
- `Pose::looking(v)` (`ui/robot.rs`): `head_dx_dip = 7 v`, `tilt_deg = 6 v`,
  `eye_dx_dip = 4 v` (constants `LOOK_HEAD_DIP`, `LOOK_TILT_DEG`,
  `LOOK_EYE_DIP`). `RobotPainter::paint` slides and tilts the head and ears
  (the tilt adds to the face's own, around the same pivot (32, 40)) and slides
  the face's marks by the extra eye offset, all converted with `k = area.w /
  GRID`.

## The clamp

`the_looking_cat_stays_in_the_idle_island` (geometry.rs) draws every face the
idle view shows (Idle, Happy, Think, Sad, Sleep; open-eyed and blinking) as
`RobotPainter::paint` does: the head outline, both ears turned for the face's
droop with their round strokes, and the box of every face mark (the eyes and
what floats beside the head) slid by the eye offset, all under the face's own
tilt and bob plus the look's tilt and slide (`Pose::looking_as`). Head and ears
must stay inside the idle island, and everything left of the clock box, for
both styles, every notch size (160..300 x 28..44), with or without the clock,
at v = -1..1.

The head slide came down from 8 to 7 dip: at 8 the sad cat's drooped right ear
tip, swung right by the 6 degree tilt, reached about 0.3 dip into the clock
box. The extras need no reduction because Think and Sleep do not look (at
full look they reached 4 to 7 dip into the clock). If the idle layout changes
(a wider clock, a smaller gap) or a face gains a mark, that test says whether
`LOOK_HEAD_DIP` must come down.

## Cost

The poll (`TIMER_POINTER`) is slow far from the top edge (250 ms) and 33 ms
within 150 dip of it. The look itself only runs the `FrameClock` while the ease
moves: a poll that changes the target by 0.02 or more calls `ensure_clock`;
`animate` eases the look before each draw (`advance_look`); `animating_at`
counts `look.moving()`. When the cat stops being eligible, `sync_look` snaps
the look to 0 with no ease. There is no eased return: every way to lose
eligibility either hides the cat (off, another view, the eyes, fullscreen),
leaves nobody to see it (locked, display off), stops motion, or turns to a
face that `Pose::looking_as` draws centred anyway. (An earlier eased-release
branch tested the same conditions as `look_eligible`, so it could never run;
it and `LookEase::release` were removed.)

With "Di belakang jendela" on, the poll keeps running while stay-behind has
lowered the island to `Z::Bottom` (the cat may still be seen on the desktop),
but `on_pointer_timer` sets no target while a window lies over the island
(`App::look_hidden_behind`: `island_covered`, the window at the island's
centre, cached for `UNDER_RECHECK`, 1 s, in `cover_cache`, cleared whenever
the island goes up or down). So a maximized window over the notch costs the
poll's `GetCursorPos` and at most one `WindowFromPoint` a second, never the
frame clock or a draw. The look stays where it was and goes on from there
once the island rises or the window moves away.

v3.8: **"Ikuti kursor"** (`cat_follow_pointer`, Settings → Kucing → Gerak, on
by default) is part of "When": `look_eligible` needs
`pointer_watch::look_allowed(robot, cat_follow_pointer)`; off, the cat stays
centred and the poll may stop ([[bata-idle-power-budget]]). The clamp test
also takes every accessory's box now ([[cat-accessories]]); `LOOK_HEAD_DIP`
stayed 7. Accessories follow the same slide and tilt (the glasses the eyes').

Demo scenes: `bata-look-left`, `bata-look-right` (the idle cat at -1 / +1).

Not verified live: the feel of the ease with a real pointer, and how the tilt
reads on a see-through notch.

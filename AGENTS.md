# Agent rules

## Models per phase (set in `.claude/workflows/build.js`)

| Phase | Model |
|---|---|
| Plan | Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) |
| Build (write the code) | Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) |
| Review and fix | Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) |
| Check | Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) |
| Ship | Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) |
| Finish (memory, README, push) | Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) |

- Spawning subagents (Agent tool) is allowed whenever it helps: parallel
  reading, independent tasks, blind reviewers, fixers. Set each agent's model
  from the table above for the phase it works in.
- Review and fix loop until the review comes back clean (up to 3 rounds).
- If a model cannot be selected (for example `model_not_found`), say so and
  ask before falling back to another model.

## Every code change goes through the `build` workflow

The workflow is the one from Gxl-WorkFlow (`D:\GitHub\Gxl-WorkFlow`,
`template/.claude/workflows/build.js`), copied unchanged with its model rules
(the table above). To update it, copy the template file again.

I opt in to multi-agent orchestration for this project. Whenever I ask for a code
change (new feature, bug fix, refactor), run the `build` workflow
(`.claude/workflows/build.js`) with my request as `args`. Do not edit the code
yourself in the main session.

- Do not weigh the tasks yourself. The workflow's Plan step (Opus) splits the
  request and marks each task `light` or `heavy`. Light tasks get build only
  (the builder and Ship run the tests). Heavy tasks get build, a blind review of
  a pinned commit (fixes land in the builder's worktree), and a check against a
  written checklist. What the checker cannot test lands in `manualChecks` for me.
- The workflow merges passing tasks into `main` locally. Once everything is
  ready (every task merged, reviewed, fixed and checked where required, tests
  green on `main`, nothing `incomplete`), its Finish step **always** updates the
  Obsidian memory and `README.md`, commits those docs, and pushes `main`. This
  project uses a single branch (`main`), so that push is pre-approved. Deploy
  stays with me.
- If anything is not ready, the workflow skips docs and push. Fix what it
  reports first; don't push half-finished work from the main session.
- For a long batch of runs, pass `args: {request, defer: true}` to build now,
  then run one verify pass with `args: {verify: [...]}` (the `deferred` list the
  runs returned) at the end. Deferred runs never push; the verify pass does the
  Finish step.
- When it finishes, report: which tasks were merged and their weight, what the
  Finish step wrote to memory and README, whether `main` was pushed,
  `manualChecks`, `incomplete`, and any open findings or failed checks.

## Every new task starts in a new session

The main session only takes tasks in; the thinking happens elsewhere. When I give
a new task that would run `build` (new feature, bug fix, refactor), do not
brainstorm or plan it here. Start a new session for it right away, without
asking me first, and tell me in one line which session it is.

- Start it with `start_session`, context `fresh`. The brief holds my request in
  my own words plus whatever from this conversation it needs, and says: "You
  were started by the main session to brainstorm and plan this task with the
  user, then run `build`. Follow 'Always brainstorm before `build`' in
  AGENTS.md. Skip 'Session start'. Do not start another session."
- A session started that way brainstorms and plans in itself and runs `build`
  itself. This rule does not apply inside it, so it never spawns another one:
  anything I add or change there, even a new request, stays in that session.
- One session per task. If I give several tasks at once, start one session each.
- Follow-ups, corrections or answers about a task that already has a session go
  to that session (`SendMessage`), not to a new one.
- What is not a new task stays here: questions, explanations, reading code, and
  anything under "When NOT to run it".
- If this environment has no way to start a session, brainstorm in the current
  session instead.

## Always brainstorm before `build`

Agents inside the workflow cannot ask me anything, so every open question gets
settled first, in the session that owns the task, with me. Before every `build`
run:

- Restate what you understood in a few lines, then ask about whatever is
  unclear: the goal, who uses it, the exact behaviour and edge cases, what must
  not change, and what "done" means. Ask a few focused questions at a time.
- For larger or open-ended work, propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs and
  recommend one.
- Even for a small, clear request, restate it in one or two lines and wait for
  my OK.
- Only when I confirm, run `build` with the agreed request written out
  concretely, including the acceptance criteria.

## Session start (main session only)

Runs only in the session I first talk to in this project, never in a session
started from it (those skip it; the main session already did it). No commands
unless a check says so:

- If `.claude/preflight.done` does not exist, read `.claude/setup/session-start.md`
  and follow its "Preflight" section.
- If a `superpowers:*` skill is in your skill list, read the same file and follow
  its "Superpowers" section. With none in the list, do nothing.

## Tools (main session and every workflow agent)

- **RTK**: shell output goes through RTK to save tokens. The global Bash hook
  rewrites commands. Prefer `rtk git`, `rtk test`, `rtk grep`, etc., and use
  `rtk bypass <cmd>` only when a result is unusable.
- **Context7**: for any library, framework, SDK, CLI or API, look up current
  docs with the Context7 MCP (`resolve-library-id`, then `query-docs`) before
  answering or writing code. Match the version the project uses.
- **Obsidian memory**: project memory lives in the Obsidian vault at `docs/`.
  Notes go in `docs/memory/`, and the index is `docs/memory/index.md`.
  - The session that owns a task reads the index and the notes relevant to it
    before starting. A session that only hands the task off does not, and nobody
    lists the notes folder.
  - After work that taught something worth keeping (a decision, gotcha,
    convention), add or update one note per fact. Give it frontmatter with
    `tags` and `date`, `[[wikilinks]]` to related notes, and a link from the
    index. The `build` workflow does this in its Finish step.
  - Don't save what the code or git history already records. Update an
    existing note instead of creating a duplicate.

## When NOT to run it

- Questions, explanations, reading code, or planning without changes.
- Edits that are not code: docs, README, comments, config values, typos.
- When I explicitly say "do it directly" / "tanpa workflow".

## Project commands

Rust (edition 2024), Windows 11 x64 only. Needs the stable Rust toolchain with
the MSVC target (`rustup`, `cargo`); CI builds with `cargo build --release --locked`.

- Install: `rustup toolchain install stable --profile minimal` (deps come via cargo)
- Build: `cargo build --release --locked` → `target/release/vale.exe`
- Test: `cargo test --locked` (unit tests live inside `src/**` as `#[cfg(test)]` modules)
- Run locally: `cargo run --release`. The island is a single-instance UI at the
  top of the screen; stop any installed copy first (`Stop-Process -Name vale, dynamic-island`).
- Demo and debug modes for visuals (no real user data, no media keys):
  `--demo`, `--demo-editor`, `--demo-cli`, `--demo-robot`, `--demo-devices`, `--settings`.
- Release: push a `v*` tag; `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and publishes.
